<p>
  Iâ€™ve always been driven to break 
  down the divide between technology 
  and people, and I get satisfaction 
  from making things that are genuine 
  valuable to people â€” whether UI, 
  product, or artwork.
</p>
<p>
  Recently Iâ€™ve supported startups 
  and small enterprise in their design 
  capabilities, usually providing a 
  range of functions. I hesitate to 
  call it holistic design, but that's 
  what it is. I work across user research, 
  UX design, UI design, and frontend 
  development. My work has also crossed 
  visual design, branding, marketing, 
  and comms when needed. The core 
  discipline is Product Design.
</p>
<p>
  I employ the principles of user-centered 
  design and design thinking. My approach is 
  to create a framework, add content, then 
  design UI. I also facilitate input from 
  all stakeholders to these equally important 
  phases.
</p>
<p>
  My preference is to work closely with 
  small cross-functional software teams 
  alongside product management, data science,
  and software development, though Iâ€™ve 
  sucessfully fit into various team structures. 
  I see my role in the team as the advocate 
  for the user or customer. Iâ€™ll work with 
  Product Managers to identify opportunities 
  and help prioritise work, and software teams 
  to develop requirements. To achieve buy-in 
  and feasible and practical solutions Iâ€™ll 
  frequently co-create with domain experts 
  and my team.
</p>
<p>
  Unusually for a designer I have fairly 
  deep front-end development knowledge, 
  and I consider this as vital a craft as 
  visual design, and they each inform the 
  other.
</p>

  Please take a few minutes to read my case 
  studies, and contact me if youâ€™d like to 
  meet up or learn more.
