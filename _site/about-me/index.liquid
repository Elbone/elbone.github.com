  Iâ€™m an Australian designer and artist.
</p>
<p>
  Born in Germany, I was raised in Tasmania, 
  and spent most of my adult life in 
  Melbourne, with a few globe-spanning side 
  trips along the way. I recently moved to 
  Tasmania with my wife, son, and dog.
</p>
<p>
  On one european adventure at 19 I was 
  introduced to graffiti lyfe, and I havenâ€™t 
  been able to shake the addiction since. 
  I make art across many media.
</p>
<p>
  My working life has been varied and rich, 
  from the early days working in small 
  culturally-leaning design studios, 
  through top of town advertising, and 
  software and startups. I havenâ€™t been 
  content to stand still, and I donâ€™t 
  think Iâ€™ll ever stop looking for new 
  challenges in this thing called â€˜designâ€™. 
  The last 5 years have been focused very 
  much on startup and tech land, and 
  Iâ€™ve felt right at home.
</p>
<p>
  Once described as a polymath, many creative 
  pursuits occupy my waking life â€” lettering, 
  graffiti, drawing, home improvement, and of 
  course my work as a Digital Maker.
</p> 
<p>
  Dodging snakes while trail running with my 
  dog, Nutmeg, is my on-the-reg workout.
