      </h1>
      <p>
  <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/">Redbubble</a>
  is an online print-on-demand open marketplace 
  catering to independent creatives 
  (called ‚Äúartists‚Äù internally). They are one 
  of Australia‚Äôs biggest online business and 
  manage thousands of transactions every day. 
  After a couple months supporting a rebrand 
  I settled in the Marketplace team as the 
  Product Designer. 
</p>
<h2>
  Context
</h2>
<p>
  At Redbubble, like in most retail, one of the 
  most valuable sales mechanisms is the addition 
  of new products to the range. My role required 
  delivering dozens of products into the marketplace, 
  and to work with my team to extract maximum value 
  from that process.
</p>
<p>
  The company was going through a tough growth phase, 
  struggling with software architecture straining 
  under the volume of transactions and content 
  on the site. Adding new products was increasingly 
  risky and the Marketplace team were deep into 
  rewriting core parts of the system while 
  continuing to launch new products.

<h2>
  Issues
</h2>
<p>
  Historically when launching new products in 
  the marketplace the entire database of millions 
  of designs in the system were programmatically 
  applied (or ‚Äúmigrated‚Äù) to the new product to 
  populate the catalogue of (virtual) products. 
</p>
<p>
  The first few days in a product launch are 
  critical to sales and migrated catalogue pages 
  were sub-standard as many designs just weren‚Äôt 
  suitable for the new product (eg. a repeating 
  pattern is odd on a tee).
</p>
<p>
  The net impacts were underwhelming product 
  launches, missed sales, poor customer 
  satisfaction, and disappointment for artists, 
  as well as significant pain for developers 
  managing the migration. This process was costly 
  on many fronts and needed to be improved.
</p>
<h2>
  Strategy
</h2>
<p>
  Qualitive research we‚Äôd gathered from the artist 
  community pointed to a solution: stage the release 
  of products into the marketplace. From pre-release 
  through to launch, artists should be given an 
  opportunity to customise designs for new product 
  before it went live to consumers.

<p>
  Working with the team‚Äôs BA I set about defining 
  how that experience would work for artists and 
  consumers, and what was required to make it
  happen.
</p>
<p>
  After months of work from the team we launched
  our first staged product using the new approach
  and were able to celebrate better SRPs, better 
  sales, and higher artist satisfaction. Also, 
  with and de-risked product launches developers 
  were freed up to work on improving the platform.
</p>
<h2>
  Opportunities
</h2>
<p>
  With improved product launches came greater 
  opportunities to optimise the experience for 
  artists and customers. Through my user interviews 
  and some A/B testing we identified that the 
  most valuable thing we could do was improve 
  both the quality and number of images of 
  for all products.
</p>
<p>
  From there I sought understanding of what 
  customers wanted from product images through 
  a combination of market research (provided 
  by the product team) and user interviews. 
  Based on what we learned I co-created 
  photography briefs with the product team ‚Äî
  specifying product angles, details, and special 
  requirements for shots. I then attended photo 
  shoots playing the role of art director and 
  technical advisor.
</p>
<p>
  A significant Redbubble innovation was the use 
  of 3D image mapping mixed with photography to
  produce very realistic looking product previews.
  While developers worked on the tech to increase
  the volume of previews the system could handle
  I worked with an imaging expert to improve the 
  preview production pipeline and process (as 
  well as getting on the tools to develop the 
  complex preview assets).

<p>
  Using this new process we were able to 
  consistently launch 12 products a year 
  on average (a notable increase from previous), 
  and deliver with overall higher quality 
  and volume. This resulted in more successful 
  product launches and more high-performing 
  products in general.
