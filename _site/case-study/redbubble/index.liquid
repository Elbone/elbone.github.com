      <p>
  <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/">Redbubble</a>
  is an open online print-on-demand 
  marketplace catering to independent creatives 
  (called ‚Äúartists‚Äù internally). They are one 
  of Australia‚Äôs biggest online business and 
  manage thousands of transactions every day. 
  After a couple months supporting the rebrand 
  I settled in the Marketplace team as the 
  Product Designer. 
</p>
<h2>
  Context
</h2>
<p>
  One of the most valuable sales mechanisms 
  is the addition of new products to the range. 
  I was tasked with delivering dozens of products 
  into the marketplace and to work with my team 
  to extract maximum value from that process. 
  My role served two user groups, the artists 
  and the customers.
</p>
<p>
  RB was going through a tough growth phase, 
  struggling with software architecture straining 
  under the volume of transactions and content 
  on the site. Adding new products was increasingly 
  risky and the Marketplace team were deep into 
  rewriting core parts of the system while 
  continuing to launch new products.

<h2>
  Issues
</h2>
<p>
  Historically when launching new products in 
  the marketplace the entire database of millions 
  of designs in the system were programmatically 
  applied (or ‚Äúmigrated‚Äù) to the new product to 
  populate the catalogue of (virtual) products. 
</p>
<p>
  The first few days in a product launch are 
  critical and catalogue pages were of a poor 
  standard ‚Äî some designs weren‚Äôt suitable 
  for the product, or needed manual configuration.
</p>
<p>
  The net impacts were missed sales, poor customer 
  satisfaction, and disappointment for artists, 
  as well as significant pain for developers 
  managing the migration. This process was costly 
  on many fronts and needed to be improved.
</p>
<h2>
  Strategy
</h2>
<p>
  With my input the strategy the team developed 
  was to stage the release of products. From 
  pre-release through to launch in the marketplace, 
  artists were given an opportunity to create or 
  modify designs especially for the product 
  before it went live.
</p>

<p>
  The outcome was better SRPs, better sales, 
  higher creator satisfaction, the risks of 
  launching a product were mitigated, and 
  developers were freed up.
</p>
<h2>
  Opportunities
</h2>
<p>
  With improved product launches came greater 
  opportunities to optimise the experience for 
  artists and customers. Through my user interviews 
  and some A/B testing we identified that the 
  there was nothing more valuable than to improve 
  both the quality and number of images of 
  each product.
</p>
<p>
  From there I sought understanding of what 
  customers wanted from previews through 
  a combination of market research (provided 
  by the product team) and user interviews. 
  Based on what we learned I developed 
  photography briefs specifying product angles, 
  details, and special requirements for shots. 
  I attended photo shoots playing the role of 
  art director and technical advisor. After 
  preview photography came the complex process 
  of creating the image assets used to compose 
  realistic previews.
</p>
<p>
  A significant Redbubble innovation was the use 
  of 3D image mapping mixed with photography to
  produce very realistic looking product previews.
  While developers worked on the tech to increase
  the volume of previews the systen could handle
  I worked with an imaging expert to improve the 
  preview production pipeline and process.

<p>
  Using this new process I was able to 
  consistently launch 12 products a year 
  on average (an increase from previous), 
  and delivery with overall higher quality 
  and volume. This resulted in more successful 
  product launches and more high-performing 
  products in general.
