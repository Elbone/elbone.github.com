      <p>
  <a href="http://www.billcap.com/">Billcap</a>
  operate a software platform to support 
  key business functions of retailers in the 
  Australian energy market. Their software 
  products enable innovation and differentiation 
  through their modularity, flexibility and 
  affordability.
</p>
<p>
  I worked with Billcap in 2015, and in 2017 
  was hired as Lead UX and UI Designer and 
  Developer. I owned several key projects
  over a 12 month period.
</p>
<h2>
  Problem
</h2>
<p>
  While having demonstrated the efficacy 
  of their products, and gathering attention 
  in one of the most competitive energy 
  markets in the world, Billcap were relying 
  on a thin brand and ad-hoc communication 
  strategy. In order to acquire customers 
  and be treated seriously they needed to 
  differentiate themselves from powerful
  incumbents.
</p>
<p>
  While confident about their proven products, 
  there was also uncertainty about how to draw 
  value from other parts of the platform, and 
  how to pitch them to potential customers.

<h2>
  Research
</h2>
<p>
  I conducted a series of interviews with 
  various decision-makers in the energy industry 
  to gather deeper qualitive data. My research
  validated a foundational Billcap belief: 
  there is frustration in the industry around 
  existing software providers â€” 
  they are almost prohibitively expensive, 
  change-resistant, somewhat old-fashioned, 
  and barely receptive to input from their 
  customers.
</p>
<p>
  Card-sort exercises revealed how customers 
  ranked the features and benefits of the Billap
  platform. The data I gathered informed not 
  just brand and messaging, but also product 
  development.

<h2>
  Outcomes
</h2>
<p>
  To position itself as the antithesis of the 
  competition I proposed Billcap highlight and 
  provide evidence of its modern work practices: 
  modular architecture, open working relationships 
  with customers, automation, and a data-driven 
  approach.
</p>
<p>
  I used this understanding to create a framework, 
  to confidently start developing the Billcap 
  brand. First I explicitly transposed customer 
  concerns into benefits. Then, in consultation 
  with the team I began creating key brand components 
  from positioning statements, through brand 
  character, to the tagline â€˜Utility Innovation Nowâ€™ 
  as the summation of brand intent.

<h2>
  Website
</h2>
<p>
  Armed with a conceptual framework I began 
  producing brand assets to support it.
  I designed the logo and product icons,
  defined colours palettes, and selected 
  fonts to develop a practical and flexible
  brand kit.
</p>
<p>
  With an extremly tight timeframe I 
  then set about developing wireframes, 
  content, and visual design for the
  <a href="http://www.billcap.com/">company website</a>, 
  before getting on the tools to build it out.

<h2>
  Rollout
</h2>
<p>
  Over the next 6 months I progressively 
  rolled out the brand design to various 
  pieces of collateral including UIs, 
  brochures, apparel, and a tradeshow 
  booth.

<h2>
  UI component library
</h2>
<p>
  Serve is Billcap's billing and customer 
  management application. I developed a UI 
  component library to drive the UI development 
  of the app and subsequent UIs. The design aims 
  for a clarity, simplicity, and personality not 
  often found in enterprise applications. 
  This project is currently on hold.
