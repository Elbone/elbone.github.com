      <p>
  <a href="http://www.billcap.com/">Billcap</a>
  is a software platform for retailers in the 
  Australian energy market. Billcapâ€™s mission 
  is to enable innovation and differentiation 
  by offering more flexible and affordable 
  software for key business functions.
</p>
<p>
  I worked with Billcap briefly in 2015, and 
  then was hired in 2017 as Lead UX and UI 
  Designer and Developer.
</p>
<h2>
  Problem
</h2>
<p>
  While having demonstrated the efficacy 
  of their products, and gathering attention 
  in one of the most competitive energy 
  markets in the world, Billcap were relying 
  on an ad-hoc communication strategy and 
  thin brand. In order to acquire customers 
  and be treated seriously they needed a 
  clear brand and comms strategy to 
  differentiate themselves from the incumbent
  competitors.
</p>
<p>
  Also, while confident about their 
  proven products there was uncertainty
  about the value of other parts of the 
  platform and how to pitch them.

<h2>
  Research
</h2>
<p>
  A series of interviews I conducted with 
  various decision-makers in the energy industry 
  provided deeper qualitive data on a foundational 
  Billcap belief: there is frustration in the 
  industry around existing software providers â€” 
  theyalmost prohibitively expensive, 
  change-resistant, somewhat old-fashioned, 
  and barely receptive to input.
</p>
<p>
  Card-sort exercises also revealed which features 
  and benefits of the platform they cared the most 
  about, and in which priority. The data gathered 
  informed not just brand and messaging, but also 
  product prioritisation.

<h2>
  Outcomes
</h2>
<p>
  To position itself as the antithesis of the 
  competition Billcap needed to provide evidence 
  of itâ€™s modern work practices: modular architecture, 
  open working relationships with customers, automation, 
  and data science. My brand and comms work would 
  explicitly transpose customer concerns into benefits.
</p>
<p>
  I used this understanding to create a framework, 
  to confidently start developing the Billcap brand. 
  In consultation with the team I began creating key 
  brand components from positioning statements, 
  through brand character, to the tagline 
  â€˜Utility Innovation Nowâ€™ as the summation of 
  brand intent.

<h2>
  Website
</h2>
<p>
  Armed with the framework I began producing 
  brand assets like the logo, product icons,
  colours palettes, font selections, example 
  layouts, etc. These were then applied 
  to layouts before being applied to a 
  <a href="http://www.billcap.com/">new website</a> 
  where I delivered wireframes, content, 
  visual design and site build in a brisk 
  3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
  Over the next 6 months I progressively 
  rolled out the brand design to various 
  pieces of collateral including UIs, 
  brochures, apparel, and a tradeshow booth.
