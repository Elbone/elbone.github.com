<p>
  I’m an Australian designer and artist.
  Born in Germany, raised in Tasmania, 
  with most of my adult life spent in 
  Melbourne, with a few globe-spanning side 
  trips along the way. I recently returned 
  to Tasmania with my wife, son, and dog.

  On one european adventure at 19 I was 
  introduced to

    text="graffiti lyfe" 
  %}, and I haven’t been able to shake 
  the addiction since. I make 
  {% include link.html

    text="art" 
  %}
  across many media.
</p>
<p>
  My working life has been varied and rich, 
  from the early days working in small 
  culturally-leaning 
  {% include link.html 
    href="http://www.letterbox.net.au/"
    text="design studios" 
  %}, 
  through top of town advertising, and 
  software and startups. I haven’t been 
  content to stand still, and I don’t 
  think I’ll ever stop looking for new 
  challenges in this thing called ‘design’. 
  The last five years have been focused very 
  much on startup and tech land, and 
  I’ve felt right at home.
</p>
<p>
  Many creative pursuits occupy my waking life 
  — lettering, graffiti, drawing, gardening,
  making home wares, home improvement, 
  and of course my work as a Digital Maker.

  and Wallabies while trail running with 
  my dog, Nutmeg, is my on-the-reg workout.
