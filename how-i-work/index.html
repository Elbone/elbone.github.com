<p>
  I’ve always been driven to break 
  down the divide between technology 
  and people, and I get satisfaction 
  from making things that are genuine 
  valuable to people — whether UI, 
  product, or artwork.
</p>
<p>
  Recently I’ve supported startups 
  and small enterprise in their design 
  capabilities, usually providing a 
  range of functions. I hesitate to 
  call it holistic design, but that's 
  what it is. I work across user research, 
  UX design, UI design, and frontend 
  development. My work has also crossed 
  visual design, branding, marketing, 
  and comms when needed. The core 
  discipline is Product Design.
</p>
<p>
  I employ the principles of user-centered 
  design and design thinking. My approach is 
  to create a framework, add content, then 
  design UI. I also facilitate input from 
  all stakeholders to these equally important 
  phases.
</p>
<p>
  My preference is to work closely with 
  small cross-functional software teams 
  alongside product management, data science,
  and software development, though I’ve 
  sucessfully fit into various team structures. 
  I see my role in the team as the advocate 
  for the user or customer. I’ll work with 
  Product Managers to identify opportunities 
  and help prioritise work, and software teams 
  to develop requirements. To achieve buy-in 
  and feasible and practical solutions I’ll 
  frequently co-create with domain experts 
  and my team.
</p>
<p>
  Unusually for a designer I have fairly 
  deep front-end development knowledge, 
  and I consider this as vital a craft as 
  visual design, and they each inform the 
  other.

  Please take a few minutes to read my case 
  studies, and contact me if you’d like to 
  meet up or learn more.
